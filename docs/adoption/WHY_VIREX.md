# Why Virex (Startup Edition)

Virex is optimized for teams that need:
- deterministic state transitions
- high performance under rapid feature iteration
- debugging visibility beyond basic widget rebuild traces

## Key differentiators
- strict reactive runtime phases
- topological recompute guarantees
- flush epoch versioning for deterministic replay
- graph invariant checks for runtime integrity

## Startup outcomes
- lower regression risk during fast iteration
- faster root-cause analysis for state bugs
- cleaner migration paths from legacy state solutions
