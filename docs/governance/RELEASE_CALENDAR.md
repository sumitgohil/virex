# Release Calendar

- Weekly patch window target: once per week
- Monthly minor release target: once per month
- Quarterly roadmap refresh target: once per quarter

## Branching
- `main` for active stable development
- `release/*` cut monthly

## Notes

- Calendar targets are operational defaults and may shift for critical fixes.
- Security or data-loss issues bypass the regular patch window.
